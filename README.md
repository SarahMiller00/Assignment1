Hi!
I was not able to figure out how to implement the input file into my source code. So, you won't be able to see the outputs of the functions. However I think the logic is there in the code.
I have a header file declaring all of the functions I use in my cpp file.
My cpp file has all of the functions addressing the assignment. 
If you could point out what I did wrong in file streaming my code that would be great.

Thank you,
Sarah Miller
